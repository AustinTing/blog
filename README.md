## Deployment

- Cloudflare Pages dashboard: `https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/<account-id>/pages/view/<CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME>` (replace placeholders after creating the project).
- Required GitHub Secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME`.
- The API Token should include the **Cloudflare Pages** and **Workers KV Storage** permissions scoped to the target account.
